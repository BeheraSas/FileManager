**Part A**
The script handles the creation and write permissions of a file, and ensures that the user is the owner of the file before appending the contents of ls -1.
If the user is not the owner, an appropriate message will be displayed instead.

**Part B**
The Bash script takes the path of a directory and a file extension as input parameters and displays the total number of files with that extension in the directory. 
The paths can be relative or absolute. If the file extension is not passed, the script would display the total number of all files in the directory.
